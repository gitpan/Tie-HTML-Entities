NAME
    Tie::HTML::Entities - Scalars tied to HTML encoding

REQUIREMENTS
    "Tie::HTML::Entities" should work on Perl 5.005 but it was written and
    tested on v5.6.1.

    It uses the "HTML::Entities" module;

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::HTML::Entities;

      my  $text;
      tie $text, 'Tie::HTML::Entities', param("text");

      print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n",
         "<body>", $text, "</body>";

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a mere experiment for examining the usefulness of using
    tied scalars with HTML entities. Raw text can be assigned to a tied
    variable but output as HTML (entity) encoded text.

  METHODS

    An object-oriented interface is provided. For example,

      my $obj = tied( $text );

    You can use the following methods on the object:

    new
          $obj = new Tie::HTML::Entities SCALAR;

        Creates a new object. SCALAR is the default ''value'' of that
        object.

    store
          $obj->store( SCALAR );

        Stores the value of the SCALAR.

    fetch_raw
          $obj->fetch_raw;

        Returns the raw (unencoded) value.

    fetch_encoded
          $obj->fetch_encoded;

        Returns the encoded value.
